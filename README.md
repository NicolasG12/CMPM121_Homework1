# Description
My scene is a mythical forest in a valley surrounded by mountains that includes many different kinds of animals, as well as some mythical  creatures. These creatures range from a rabbit, to a bear, to even a dragon flying above the scene. Nothing really inspired me to make this scene, other than the fact that I am into fantasy settings. The main character in my scene is Unity-chan, an anime girl asset that I found on the Unity Asset Store made by Unity Japan.
